# Data Collect Web Display #

Intended for uploading data from embedded projects like Arduino boards, ESP8266, ESP32,... 
Sensor data like Temperature, Humidity, Moisture, etc, will be displayed as graphic functions.
Controll variables are used to switch relays or LEDs ON/OFF, so they are displayed as buttons or input boxes depending on variable type. The supported variable types are "toggle" (buttons) and all other variables (input boxes). 

## How to start ##
The "WebServer" folder contains the web interface you can use on your local network or deploy it on a hosting service. It will give you data overview and controll interface for your network enabled devices.

The "ArduinoExamples" folder contains examples for ESP8266 board used as an automatic plant watering system control.

Refer to README.md in each folder for more details.

## Branches ##

In this repository you will find: 
1. "main" git branch is for multiple users and intended to provide a hub for use in multiple simultanious projects.
2. "single_user_private_app" git branch is a simplified version for single user with hardcoded account.

I have deployed this solution and you can try it at: https://datacollect.ohanacode-dev.com/
